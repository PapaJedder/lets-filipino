## 3 Tips to Sound Like a Native Tagalog Speaker
1. Consume media
2. Learn the expressions
3. Focused Vocabulary


### Consume Media
Like most language learners, you are learning Tagalog on your own.  You might not have a language parent.  A language parent is a native-level speaker that can guide you through your learning process.  

It might be challenge to find a luanguage parent online on within your area.  
So instead of looking for a language parent, immerse yourself with audio and video material.
You can easily find a ton of material on Youtube alone.  
Don't worry about understanding the shows.  The more important thing is that you are just consuming.  I also sugest not to use subtitles.

Below are just a few channels on Youtube.
